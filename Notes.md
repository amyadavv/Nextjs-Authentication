1. Everything you work will go inside the src directory. Inside Src there is app directory. App directory will have backend and frontend.
2. It is not just everything is goes inside the app directory. There are other files which are created outside the app directory. For examples models and helpers etc.
3. We will see that the backend portion is actually written inside the API folder. Whenever you are writing most of the part of the apis in the backend you are using file name as "route" 
4. In case of the frontend part the file name is "page"
5. The naming convention is super super important in the next js. Slightest wrong in the naming convention will just create a havoc in the folder. Nextjs is a framework and we have to follow the rule and regulation.
6. There is also a directory inside the src but not inside the app, which is middleware. It can be inside app directory.
7. So inside the app directory there will be backend, frontend, login, signup folder.





If the file is used for frontend then we have to call it page, otherwise everything will be crashed
