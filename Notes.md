1. Everything you work will go inside the src directory. Inside Src there is app directory. App directory will have backend and frontend.
2. It is not just everything is goes inside the app directory. There are other files which are created outside the app directory. For examples models and helpers etc.
3. We will see that the backend portion is actually written inside the API folder. Whenever you are writing most of the part of the apis in the backend you are using file name as route 
4. The naming convention is super super important in the next js. Slightest wrong in the naming convention will just create a havoc in the folder. Nextjs is a framework and we have to follow the rule and regulation.





If the file is used for frontend then we have to call it page, otherwise everything will be crashed
